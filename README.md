# guess-the-number
This game gives you a random unknown number to guess, through javascript we save the 
user's input in a variable, afterwards we create a random number and save that value to
another variable. We utilize those variables in IF and ELSE IF statements to verify if
the users guess correctly matches the unknown random number. We then use a while loop to
display how accurate the users input is to the random number.
